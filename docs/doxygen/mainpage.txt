@section Introduction
HOPR (High Order Preprocessor) is an open-source software for the generation of three-dimensional unstructured high-order meshes.
These meshes are needed for high-order methods like Discontinuous Galerkin schemes, Spectral Element Methods or pFEM, if boundary
conditions have to be applied at curved domain boundaries, like for example a flow past a cylinder or a sphere.

The software was developed in the Numerics Research Group of Prof. Claus-Dieter Munz at the Institute of Aerodynamics and 
Gasdynamics at the University Stuttgart. Copyright (C) 2014
