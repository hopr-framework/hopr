The number of a vector's component represents the nth boundary condition in order of its position <br>in the file. Hence, each position refers to the six box sides `(/z-,y-,x+,y+,x-,z+/)`. In this example six different <br>boundary conditions were assigned to the box surfaces. In case of a boundary condition defined on several <br>faces, the components belonging to these faces will be equal in the `BCIndex` vector. In case of multiple <br>cartesian boxes there are surfaces which coincide with other ones. To such surfaces no boundary condition <br>can be assigned. Therefore, the number of the corresponding vector's component is set to 0. For example, if all <br>components of the parameter `BCIndex` are set to `(/0,0,0,0,0,0/)` the box will be surrounded completely <br>by six other boxes so that no boundary condition can be assigned to a single surface. |

Each component of <br>the vector stands for an axis of the cartesian coordinate system. The value 0 means a deactivation of the <br>stretching function for this axis. A negative sign defines the length of the first element of the other side of <br>the box. A combination with the parameter factor ignores the element number of the defined box.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
